# ft_printf
ft_printf is a custom implementation of the standard `printf` function in C. This project, part of 42's Common Core, teaches formatted output handling, variadic functions, and low-level memory management.

This project deepened my understanding of how printf() works under the hood.

## ðŸ”§ Usage  
1. **Include at the bottom of 'ft_ptintf.c'**:
```c
int main() {
    ft_printf("Hello, %s!\n", "world");
    return 0;
}
```
2. **Compile the program**:  
   ```bash
      make
   ```

3. **Run the program**:
   ```bash
      ./ft_printf
   ```
